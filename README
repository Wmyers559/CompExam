GIFT Implementation
===================

This is a implementation of the GIFT cryptosystem that originated from William
Unger at Boise State University, and was expanded upon by Riley Myers at Idaho
National Laboratory.


You probably already know what you are doing if you are looking at this
repository. The folders are reasonably descriptive, with the one exception of
the `cofb` folder. This is the complete submission (and reference
implementation) for round one of the NIST Lightweight Cryptography proposal.


### Misc Notes

* The implementation folders (`gift`, `giftBase3`) should have a `.clang_format`
  file inside of them. This defines the code style of the project based off of
  the Mozilla coding style guide (though it honestly is more of a loose
  recommendation for this project). To automatically reformat your code, run
  `clang-format -style=file -i <files to format>`
* The `makefile` assumes that you have `clang` installed. If you need to use
  GCC, you can edit the `makefile`
* Related, the makefile recipies for ARM and AVR don't work. Sorry, they were
  not necessary. For those targets, build the project through the
  `simpleserial-gift` firmware.
